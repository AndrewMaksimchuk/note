# npn package.json field - dependecies

Dependencies are specified in a simple object that  
maps a package name to a version range.   

See semver for more details about specifying
version ranges  

`version` Must match version exactly
`>version` Must be greater than version
`>=version` etc
`<version`
`<=version`
`~version` "Approximately equivalent to version" See semver
`^version` "Compatible with version" See semver
`1.2.x` 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0
`http://...` See 'URLs as Dependencies' below
`*` Matches any version
`""` (just an empty string) Same as *
`version1 - version2` Same as `>=version1
<=version2`.
`range1 || range2` Passes if either range1 or range2 are satisfied.
`git...` See 'Git URLs as Dependencies' below
`user/repo` See 'GitHub URLs' below
`tag` A specific version tagged and published as tag See npm dist-tag
`path/path/path` See Local Paths below
