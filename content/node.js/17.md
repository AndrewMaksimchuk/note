# npm package.json field - man

Specify either a single file or an array of  
filenames to put in place for the man program to  
find.  

If only a single file is provided, then it's  
installed such that it is the result from man  
<pkgname>, regardless of its actual filename. For  
example:   

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "description": "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos",
  "main": "foo.js",
  "man": "./man/doc.1"
}
```

would link the ./man/doc.1 file in such that it is  
the target for man foo
