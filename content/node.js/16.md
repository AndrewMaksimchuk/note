# npm package.json field - bin

A lot of packages have one or more executable  
files that they'd like to install into the PATH.  
npm makes this pretty easy.  

To use this, supply a bin field in your  
package.json which is a map of command name to  
local file name.  

## For example, myapp could have this

```json
{
  "bin": {
    "myapp": "./cli.js"
  }
}
``` 

If you have a single executable, and its name  
should be the name of the package, then you can  
just supply it as a string. For example:  

```json
{
  "name": "my-program",
  "version": "1.2.5",
  "bin": "./path/to/program"
}
```

Please make sure that your file(s) referenced in  
bin starts with #!/usr/bin/env node, otherwise the  
scripts are started without the node executable!
