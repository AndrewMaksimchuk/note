# Update packages

This command will update all the packages listed  
to the latest version (specified by the tag  
config), respecting the semver constraints of both  
your package and its dependencies (if they also  
require the same package).   

It will also install missing packages.

Note that by default npm update will not update  
the semver values of direct dependencies in your  
project package.json, if you want to also update  
values in package.json you can run:  
`npm update --save` (or add the save=true option  
to a configuration file to make that the default  
behavior).  

```
npm update [<pkg>...]

aliases: up, upgrade, udpate
```
