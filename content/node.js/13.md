# Check for outdated packages

This command will check the registry to see if  
any (or, specific) installed packages are  
currently outdated.   

In the output:  
- Red means there's a newer version matching your  
	semver requirements, so you should update  
	now.
- Yellow indicates that there's a newer version  
	above your semver requirements (usually  
	new major, or new 0.x minor) so proceed  
	with caution.

```sh
npm outdated [<package-spec> ...]
```
