# npm package.json field - main

The main field is a module ID that is the primary  
entry point to your program. That is, if your  
package is named foo, and a user installs it, and  
then does require("foo"), then your main module's  
exports object will be returned.  

If main is not set, it defaults to index.js in the  
package's root folder.
