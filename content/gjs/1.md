GJS includes a command-line interpreter, usually  
installed in `/usr/bin/gjs`.  
Type `gjs` to start it and test out your  
JavaScript statements interactively.  
Hit Ctrl+D to exit.  

`gjs filename.js` runs a whole program.  
`gjs -d filename.js` does that and starts a  
debugger as well.  
Type `gjs --help` for more information.
