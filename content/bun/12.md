# Start an HTTP server on a unix domain socket with Bun.serve()

Bun.serve() now supports unix domain sockets,
which let you point a socket to a file on your
filesystem instead of a network host/port. This is
useful when you want to run a server that's only
accessible from the same machine, sometimes
containers or proxies.

```javascript
const server = Bun.serve({
  unix: "/tmp/my-socket.sock", // <-- new option
  fetch(req){
    console.log(req.url);
    return new Response("Hello world!");
  }
});

console.log(`Listening on unix:///tmp/my-socket.sock!`);
```

To start the server, run `bun ./server.ts`. 

Then, you can use `curl` to make a request to the
socket.

```sh
curl --unix-socket /tmp/my-socket.sock http://localhost/my-path
```
