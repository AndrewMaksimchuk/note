# Endianness

Is the order in which bytes within a word of
digital data are transmitted over a data
communication medium or addressed (by rising
addresses) in computer memory, counting only byte
significance compared to earliness. Endianness is
primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or
little-endian (LE).
