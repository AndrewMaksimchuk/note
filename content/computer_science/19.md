# What are the parts of a URL?

[Source web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/url-parts) 

## Country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)

A top-level domain defined in the ISO 3166-1 Country Codes list.

For https://example.org.au, the ccTLD is au.
For https://example.io, the ccTLD is io.

## Domain name

The parts of an HTTP or HTTPS URL separated by
dots: everything after the scheme, but before the
path or port (if specified). Each part of the
domain name is known as a label.

URL 					Domain name
https://example.github.io/path 		example.github.io
https://support.example.org.au:443 	support.example.org.au

## Fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)

A complete address for a website or a server, that maps to an IP address.

URL 				FQDN
https://example.com:1234/cats 	example.com
https://api.example.github.io 	api.example.github.io

## Host

As defined in the URL standard, a host can be a
domain name, IP v4 address, IPv6 address, opaque
host, or empty host.

The URL standard's definition of host does not include the port.
URL.host includes the port, unless the port is the default for the scheme.
URL.hostname does not include the port.

URL 					URL.host
https://www.example.com:443/cat 	www.example.com
					// 443 is the default port for the scheme
https://www.example.com:1234/cat 	www.example.com:1234
https://cat.example.github.io 		cat.example.github.io

## Hostname

Hostname is defined by the JavaScript URL API, but
not elsewhere by the URL standard. See host
representation for more detail.
URL.hostname returns the host without the port.

URL 					URL.hostname
https://www.example.com:443/cat 	www.example.com
https://www.example.com:1234/cat 	www.example.com
https://cat.example.github.io 		cat.example.github.io

## Origin

For HTTP or HTTPS URLs, URL.origin returns the
scheme, the host, and port (unless the port is the
default for the scheme).

URL 					URL.origin
https://www.example.com:443/cat 	https://www.example.com
https://www.example.com:1234/cat 	https://www.example.com:1234
https://cat.example.github.io 		https://cat.example.github.io

## Scheme

The part of the URL (before ://) that defines the
network protocol (or action to be taken by the
user agent) when a request is made to a URL. For
example, a request to a URL with an https scheme
should be made using the HTTPS protocol. For a
request to a URL with a scheme such as file,
mailto or git that doesn't correspond to a network
protocol, behavior depends on the user agent. For
example, when a user clicks on a mailto link, most
browsers open their default email application,
using the values in the link's href URL.
