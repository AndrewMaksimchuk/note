# Virtual methods/functions

Virtual function or virtual method is an  
inheritable and overridable function or method  
that is dispatched dynamically. Virtual functions  
are an important part of (runtime) polymorphism in  
object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow for  
the execution of target functions that were not  
precisely identified at compile time.
