# Data Backup

## 3-2-1 Rule 

– Keep 3 copies of any important file: 1 primary  
	and 2 backups
– Keep the files on 2 different media types to  
	protect against different types of hazards
– Store 1 copy offsite (e.g., outside your home  
	or business facility)

The main idea behind this recommendation is not  
to put all your eggs in one basket. Having 2  
different devices/disks ensures that a single  
hardware failure doesn’t take away all your data.  
Similarly, if you store your only backup at home  
and the house burns down or gets robbed you lose  
everything, that’s what the offsite copy is there  
for. Onsite backups give you availability and  
speed, offsite give you the resiliency should a  
disaster happen.
