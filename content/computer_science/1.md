Tail call(tail call optimization)  

Tail-call optimization is where you are able to  
avoid allocating a new stack frame for a function  
because the calling function will simply return  
the value that it gets from the called function.  
The most common use is tail-recursion, where a  
recursive function written to take advantage of  
tail-call optimization can use constant stack  
space.
