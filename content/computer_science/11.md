# Binary Tree Traversal

There are two main categories of Tree traversal  
methods:  
- Breadth First Search (BFS) is when the nodes on  
the same level are visited before going to the  
next level in the tree. This means that the tree  
is explored in a more sideways direction.  
- Depth First Search (DFS) is when the traversal  
moves down the tree all the way to the leaf  
nodes, exploring the tree branch by branch in a  
downwards direction.  

There are three different types of DFS traversals:  
- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order
 
## Pre-order Traversal of Binary Trees

```python
def preOrderTraversal(node):
    if node is None:
        return
    print(node.data, end=", ")
    preOrderTraversal(node.left)
    preOrderTraversal(node.right)
```

## In-order Traversal of Binary Trees

```python
def inOrderTraversal(node):
    if node is None:
        return
    inOrderTraversal(node.left)
    print(node.data, end=", ")
    inOrderTraversal(node.right)
```

## Post-order Traversal of Binary Trees

```python
def postOrderTraversal(node):
    if node is None:
        return
    postOrderTraversal(node.left)
    postOrderTraversal(node.right)
    print(node.data, end=", ")
```
