# Graphs

[Source](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_theory_graphs.php)  

A Graph is a non-linear data structure that  
consists of vertices (nodes) and edges.   

A vertex, also called a node, is a point or an  
object in the Graph, and an edge is used to  
connect two vertices with each other.  

Graphs are used to represent and solve problems  
where the data consists of objects and  
relationships between them.  

## Graph Properties

A *weighted* Graph is a Graph where the edges have  
values. The weight value of an edge can represent  
things like distance, capacity, time, or  
probability.  

A *connected* Graph is when all the vertices are  
connected through edges somehow. A Graph that is  
not connected, is a Graph with isolated (disjoint)  
subgraphs, or single isolated vertices.  

A *directed* Graph, also known as a digraph, is when  
the edges between the vertex pairs have a  
direction. The direction of an edge can represent  
things like hierarchy or flow.  

A *loop*, also called a self-loop, is an edge that  
begins and ends on the same vertex. A loop is a  
cycle that only consists of one edge.
