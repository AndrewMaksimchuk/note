# Proof of work

Proof of work (also written as proof-of-work, an abbreviated PoW) is a form of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended.

## Background

The concept of Proof of Work (PoW) has its roots in early research on combating spam and preventing denial-of-service attacks. One of the earliest implementations of PoW was Hashcash, created by British cryptographer Adam Back in 1997. It was designed as an anti-spam mechanism that required email senders to perform a small computational task, effectively proving that they expended resources (in the form of CPU time) before sending an email. This task was trivial for legitimate users but would impose a significant cost on spammers attempting to send bulk messages.

Hashcash's system was based on the concept of finding a hash value that met certain criteria, a task that required computational effort and thus served as a "proof of work." The idea was that by making it computationally expensive to send large volumes of email, spamming would be reduced.
