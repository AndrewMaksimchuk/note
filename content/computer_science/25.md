# Digraphs and trigraphs

In computer programming, digraphs and trigraphs are sequences of two and three characters, respectively, that appear in source code and, according to a programming language's specification, should be treated as if they were single characters.

## Example

The C preprocessor replaces all occurrences of the nine trigraph sequences in this table by their single-character equivalents before any other processing.

| Trigraph | Equivalent |
|----------|------------|
| ??=      | #          |
| ??/      | \          |
| ??'      | ^          |
| ??(      | [          |
| ??)      | ]          |
| ??!      | \|         |
| ??<      | {          |
| ??>      | }          |
| ??-      | ~          |

| Digraph | Equivalent |
|---------|------------|
| <:      | [ |
| :>      | ] |
| <%      | { |
| %>      | } |
| %:      | # |
