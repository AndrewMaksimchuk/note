The layout of your declaration files should mirror the layout of the library.  
A library can consist of multiple modules.  

Your declaration files should thus be  
@types/myLib
  +---- index.d.ts
  +---- foo.d.ts
  +---- bar
         +---- index.d.ts
         +---- baz.d.ts

Recommend you:  
1. Create a new file in the root of your source tree: [libname].d.ts  
2. Add declare module "[libname]" { }  
3. Add the template inside the braces of the declare module, and see where your usage breaks
