# Export all as x  

With TypeScript 3.8, you can use export * as ns as 
a shorthand for re-exporting another module with  
a name:  
```
export * as utilities from "./utilities";
```
This takes all of the dependencies from a module  
and makes it an exported field, you could import  
it like this:  
```
import { utilities } from "./index";
```
