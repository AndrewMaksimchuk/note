# Shorthand ambient modules  

If you donâ€™t want to take the time to write out  
declarations before using a new module, you can  
use a shorthand declaration to get started quickly.  

```typescript
//declarations.d.ts
declare module "hot-new-module";
```

All imports from a shorthand module will have  
the any type.  

```typescript
import x, { y } from "hot-new-module";
x(y);
```
