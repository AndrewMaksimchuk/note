# Utility type OmitThisParameter<Type>  

Removes the this parameter from Type. If Type has  
no explicitly declared this parameter, the result  
is simply Type. Otherwise, a new function type  
with no this parameter is created from Type.  
Generics are erased and only the last overload  
signature is propagated into the new function type.
