Template Literal Types  

Template literal types build on string literal  
types, and have the ability to expand into many  
strings via unions.  

When a union is used in the interpolated  
position, the type is the set of every possible  
string literal that could be represented by each  
union member:  
```
type EmailLocaleIDs = "welcome_email" | "email_heading";
type FooterLocaleIDs = "footer_title" | "footer_sendoff";
 
type AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;
```
