# File is module or script

In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing  
a top-level import or export is considered a module. Conversely,  
a file without any top-level import or export declarations is  
treated as a script whose contents are available in the global  
scope (and therefore to modules as well).
