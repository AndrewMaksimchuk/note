# Starting, Stopping, and Reloading Configuration

 To start nginx, run the executable file. Once  
nginx is started, it can be controlled by  
invoking the executable with the -s parameter.  
Use the following syntax:   

```sh
nginx -s signal
```

Where signal may be one of the following:  
- stop — fast shutdown
- quit — graceful shutdown
- reload — reloading the configuration file
- reopen — reopening the log files

Changes made in the configuration file will not  
be applied until the command to reload  
configuration is sent to nginx or it is  
restarted. To reload configuration, execute:  

```sh
nginx -s reload
```

The process ID of the nginx master process is  
written, by default, to the nginx.pid in the  
directory `/usr/local/nginx/logs` or `/var/run`.  
For example, if the master process ID is 1628, to  
send the QUIT signal resulting in nginx’s  
graceful shutdown, execute:  

```sh
kill -s QUIT 1628
```

For getting the list of all running nginx  
processes, the ps utility may be used, for  
example, in the following way:  

```sh
ps -ax | grep nginx
```
