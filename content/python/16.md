# __pycache__

The __pycache__ directory is created by Python to store bytecode compiled from your Python source files (.pyc files). This is done to speed up subsequent executions of your Python programs. While typically harmless, there are situations where you might want to prevent or manage its creation.

## To disable the creation of __pycache__ directories:

Set the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable to a non-empty string before running your Python script.

```sh
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
python your_script.py
```


Using the -B Command-Line Option.

```sh
python -B your_script.py
```

You can set sys.dont_write_bytecode to True at the beginning of your main script or module before any other imports occur.

```python
import sys
sys.dont_write_bytecode = True

# Your other imports and code
```
