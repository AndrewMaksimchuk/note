# How can I do a line break (line continuation) in Python (split up a long line of source code)?

## Breaking Strings

```python
long_string = (
    "This is a very long string that "
    "spans multiple lines for readability."
)


long_string = "This is a very long string that " + \
              "spans multiple lines for readability."
```

## Implicit Line Continuation

Using parentheses, brackets, or braces allows you 
to break lines without needing a backslash. This 
method is preferred for its clarity.

```python
my_list = [
    "item1",
    "item2",
    "item3"
]
```

## Explicit Line Continuation

You can also use a backslash (\) at the end of a 
line to indicate that the statement continues on 
the next line. However, this method is less 
favored due to potential readability issues.

```python
long_expression = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
                  4 - 5 * 2
```
