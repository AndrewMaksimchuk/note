#  Classes and Objects

## Create a Class and object

```python
class Person:
	def __init__(self, name, age):
		self.name = name
	  	self.age = age

	def myfunc(self):
		print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age) 
```

## The __init__() Function

All classes have a function called __init__(),
which is always executed when the class is being
initiated.  

Use the __init__() function to assign values to
object properties, or other operations that are
necessary to do when the object is being created:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)
```

## The __str__() Function

The __str__() function controls what should be
returned when the class object is represented as a
string.

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
```

## The self Parameter

The self parameter is a reference to the current
instance of the class, and is used to access
variables that belongs to the class.

It does not have to be named self , you can call
it whatever you like, but it has to be the first
parameter of any function in the class:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age
```

## The pass Statement

Class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for
some reason have a class definition with no
content, put in the pass statement to avoid
getting an error.

```python
class Person:
  pass
```
