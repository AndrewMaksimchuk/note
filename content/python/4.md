# pip - common tasks

## Install a package

```python
python -m pip install sampleproject
```

## Install multiple packages using a requirements file

Many Python projects use `requirements.txt` files, to specify the list of 
packages that need to be installed for the project 
to run. To install the packages listed in that file, you can run:

```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Upgrade a package

```python
python -m pip install --upgrade sampleproject
```

## Uninstall a package

```python
python -m pip uninstall sampleproject
```
