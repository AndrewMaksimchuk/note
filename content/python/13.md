# Modules, packages

A module is simply a file that contains definitions and declarations of functions, classes, and so on.

A directory containing modules and an __init__.py file is known as a "regular package". __init__.py can be empty.  
From Python 3.3, a directory without __init__.py can be treated as a package. Such a package is called a "namespace package".
