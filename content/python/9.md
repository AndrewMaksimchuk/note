# The global Keyword

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.  
To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.  

```python
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.

```python
 x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```
