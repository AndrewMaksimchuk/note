## Syntax

`:r[ead] [++opt] [name]` `:r*` `:re*` `:read*`  
Insert the file [name] (default: current file)  
below the cursor  

`:{range}r[ead] [++opt] [name]`  
Insert the file [name] (default: current file)  
below the specified line.  

`:[range]r[ead] [++opt] !{cmd}` `:r!*` `:read!*`  
Execute {cmd} and insert its standard output below
the cursor or the specified line.  A temporary file is
used to store the output of the command which is then
read into the buffer.  'shellredir' is used to save
the output of the command, which can be set to include
stderr or not.  {cmd} is executed like with ":!{cmd}",
any '!' is replaced with the previous command |:!|.

To insert text above the first line use the  
command `:0r {name}`.
