# Syntax highlighting

Switching it on `:syntax enable`  
If you always want to use syntax highlighting,  
put the ":syntax enable" command in your |vimrc|  
file.  

Setting the filetype can also be done with a |modeline|, so that the
file will be highlighted each time you edit it.  For example, this
line can be used in a Makefile (put it near the start or end of the
file):  
```
# vim: syntax=make
```

Select another color scheme, 
find in `colors` directory  
```vi
:colorscheme evening
```
Tell Vim to always use your color scheme. Put  
this line in your |vimrc|:  
```vimrc
colorscheme mine
```

Disable syntax highlighting for a moment:  
```vi
:syntax clear
```
