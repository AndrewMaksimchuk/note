# The expression register

The expression register allows us to perform calculations and then insert the
result directly into our document.

The expression register is addressed by the = symbol. From Insert mode we
can access it by typing <C-r>= . This opens a prompt at the bottom of the screen
where we can type the expression that we want to evaluate. When done, we
hit <CR> , and Vim inserts the result at our current position in the document. 

## Example

Keystrokes	Buffer contents
A		6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $
<C-r>=6*35<CR>	6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $210
