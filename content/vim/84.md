# --headless

Start without UI, and do not wait for nvim_ui_attach. The
builtin TUI is not used, so stdio works as an arbitrary
communication channel. channel-stdio
Also useful for scripting (tests) to see messages that would
not be printed by -es.
To detect if a UI is available, check if nvim_list_uis() is
empty during or after VimEnter.
To read stdin as text, "-" must be given explicitly:
--headless cannot assume that stdin is just text.

```
echo foo | nvim --headless +"%print" +"q!" -
```
