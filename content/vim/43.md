# wildmenu - command-line completion

When 'wildmenu' is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
mode.  On pressing 'wildchar' (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
the possible matches are shown.
When 'wildoptions' contains "pum", then the completion matches are
shown in a popup menu.  Otherwise they are displayed just above the
command line, with the first match highlighted (overwriting the status
line, if there is one).
