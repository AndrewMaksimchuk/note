# Execute the macro in parallel 

The :argdo command allows us to execute an Ex
command once for each buffer in the argument list
(see :h :argdo ).

Now we can go ahead and execute the macro in all
of the buffers in the argument list:

```
:argdo normal @a
```

## Save changes to all files

We’ve changed four files, but we haven’t saved any
of them yet. We could run :argdo write to save all
files in the argument list, but it would be
quicker simply to run this:

```
:wall
```

Note that this saves all files in the buffer list,
so it’s not exactly equivalent to :argdo write
(see :h :wa ).
