# Macros

## Record the macro

To record a macro and save it to a register, type  
the key `q` followed by a letter from `a` to `z` that  
represents the register to save the macro,  
followed by all commands you want to record, and  
then type the key `q` again to stop the recording.  

```
q<register><commands>q
```

## View and load macros

Command :reg to see the content of all registers:  
```ex
:reg
--- Registers ---
""   ,
"h   0r#f"xldf,A,^[p0df,$px:s/,/\t/g^Mj
"-   ,
...
```

You can also check the specific register  
```ex
:reg h
--- Registers ---
"h   0r#f"xldf,A,^[p0df,$px:s/,/\t/g^Mj
```

## Replay macros

Press `@h` where `h` represents the register on  
which you saved the macro.   

Notice that the macro automatically moves the  
cursor to the next line as required. This allows  
you to repeat its execution. To repeat the macro  
execution, press `@@`.  

Finally, you can repeat the macro on all  
remaining lines by using Vim `number<COMMAND>`  
syntax. For example, to execute the macro on the  
five remaining lines, press `5@@` or `5@h`.
