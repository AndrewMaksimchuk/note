# Opening the file explorer(netrw)

Ex Command	Shorthand	Effect
:edit .		:e.		Open file explorer for current working directory
:Explore	:E		Open file explorer for the directory of the active buffer

We can open the file explorer window with the :edit {path} command by supply-
ing a directory name (instead of a filename) as the {path} argument. The dot
symbol stands for the current working directory, so if we run the :edit . com-
mand, we can bring up a file explorer for the project root.

The netrw plugin provides a
more convenient way with the :Explore command (see :h :Explore ).
