# Powerful the :r! command

This reads the results of a command. It's the  
same as suspending the vi session, running a  
command, redirecting its output to a temporary  
file, resuming your vi session, and reading in  
the contents from the temp. file.  

Using the `:r!` and `!` commands means that any  
external utility or filter can be treated as an  
extension of our editor. I have occasionally used  
these with scripts that pulled data from a  
database, or with wget or lynx commands that  
pulled data off a website, or ssh commands that  
pulled data from remote systems.
