# Writing and quitting

```vi
ZZ  	     ZZ			same as ":x"
ZQ  	     ZQ			same as ":q!"
```

ZZ	Write current file, if modified, and close the current
	window (same as ":x").
	If there are several windows for the current file,
	only the current window is closed.

ZQ	Quit without checking for changes (same as ":q!").
