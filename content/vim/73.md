# Build a list of target files - open files/buffers

```
:cd code/macros/ruby_module
:args *.rb
```

Running :args without arguments reveals the
contents of the list:

```
:args
[animal.rb] banker.rb frog.rb person.rb
```

We can navigate through this list of files using
the :first, :last, :prev, and :next commands.
