# Execute Normal mode commands

:norm[al][!] {commands} 	*:norm* *:normal*

Execute Normal mode commands {commands}.  This makes
it possible to execute Normal mode commands typed on
the command-line.  {commands} are executed like they
are typed. 

`:%normal A;`

The % symbol is used as a range representing the entire file. So :%normal A;
instructs Vim to append a semicolon at the end of every line of the file. Making
this change involves switching into Insert mode, but Vim automatically reverts
to Normal mode afterward.

Before executing the specified Normal mode command on each line, Vim
moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. So we donâ€™t have to worry about
where the cursor is positioned when we execute the command. This single
command could be used to comment out an entire JavaScript file:

`:%normal i//`
