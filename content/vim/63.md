# Count

The `<C-a>` and `<C-x>` commands perform addition and subtraction on numbers.
When run without a count they increment by one, but if we prefix a number,
then we can add or subtract by any whole number. For example, if we posi-
tioned our cursor on a `5` character, running
`10<C-a>` would modify it to read `15`.
