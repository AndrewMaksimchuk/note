# skeleton template

Learn about it with `:help skeleton`  
To read a skeleton (template) file when opening  
a new file: > 
:autocmd BufNewFile  *.c      0r ~/vim/skeleton.c  
:autocmd BufNewFile  *.h      0r ~/vim/skeleton.h  
:autocmd BufNewFile  *.java   0r ~/vim/skeleton.java  

```vimscript .vimrc
autocmd BufNewFile readme.md 0r ~/skeletons/readme.md
autocmd BufNewFile *.sh 0r ~/skeletons/bash.sh
```
- autocmd – run this automatically on some event
- BufNewFile – this is Vim’s new file event
- readme.md – this is the pattern you want the new file to match
- 0r – read into the buffer starting at line 0, the first line
- ~/skeletons/readme.md – the file to read in
The second example works the same way but uses a  
file glob `*.sh` to match any file ending in `.sh`
