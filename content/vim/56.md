# Sorting text  

`:sor*` `*:sort`
:[range]sor[t][!] [b][f][i][l][n][o][r][u][x][/{pattern}/]  

Sort lines in [range].  When no range is given all
lines are sorted.  

With [!] the order is reversed.  

With [i] case is ignored.  

With [n] sorting is done on the first decimal
number in the line.  

With [f] sorting is done on the Float in the line.  

With [x] sorting is done on the first hexadecimal
number in the line.
