# ROT13

ROT13 (Rotate13, "rotate by 13 places", sometimes
hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution
cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter
after it in the Latin alphabet. ROT13 is a special
case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in
ancient Rome.

## Implementation

The ROT13 and ROT47 are fairly easy to implement
using the Unix terminal application tr; to encrypt
the string "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The
Lazy Dog" in ROT13:

```sh
$ # Map upper case A-Z to N-ZA-M and lower case a-z to n-za-m
$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' <<< "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog"
Gur Dhvpx Oebja Sbk Whzcf Bire Gur Ynml Qbt

$ echo "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog" | tr '\!-~' 'P-~\!-O'
%96 "F:4< qC@H? u@I yF>AD ~G6C %96 {2KJ s@8
``` 

In the Vim text editor, one can ROT13 a buffer
with the command `ggg?G`
