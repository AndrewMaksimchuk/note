Macros  

A macro is an action or a set of actions that you  
can run as many times as you want.  

Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code  
that writes other code, which is known as  
metaprogramming.  

Metaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount  
of code you have to write and maintain, which is  
also one of the roles of functions.
