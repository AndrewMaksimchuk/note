# HTTP method DELETE

The HTTP DELETE request method deletes the
specified resource.

## Example

```http
DELETE /file.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
``` 

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>File deleted.</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD send
- a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed but has not yet been enacted,
- a 204 (No Content) status code if the action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied, or
- a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the response message includes a representation describing the status.
