# HTTP header Authorization

The HTTP `Authorization` request header can be used
to provide credentials that authenticate a user
agent with a server, allowing access to a
protected resource.

The `Authorization` header is usually, but not
always, sent after the user agent first attempts
to request a protected resource without
credentials. The server responds with a 401
Unauthorized message that includes at least one
WWW-Authenticate header. This header indicates
what authentication schemes can be used to access
the resource.

## Syntax

```http
Authorization: <auth-scheme> <authorization-parameters>

// Basic authentication
Authorization: Basic <credentials>

// Digest authentication
Authorization: Digest username=<username>,
    realm="<realm>",
    uri="<url>",
    algorithm=<algorithm>,
    nonce="<nonce>",
    nc=<nc>,
    cnonce="<cnonce>",
    qop=<qop>,
    response="<response>",
    opaque="<opaque>"
```

## Examples

### Basic authentication

For "Basic" authentication the credentials are
constructed by first combining the username and
the password with a colon (aladdin:opensesame),
and then by encoding the resulting string in
base64 (YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l).

```http
Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
```
