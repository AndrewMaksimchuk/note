# ctags - Generate tag files for source code

The  ctags and etags programs generate an index  
(or "tag") file for a variety of language objects  
found in file(s).  This tag file allows  these   
items  to  be quickly  and easily located by a  
text editor or other utility.  

Alternatively, ctags can generate a cross  
reference file which lists, in human readable form,  
information  about  the various source objects  
found in a set of language files.  

Complete list of supported  languages run: `ctags --list-languages`
