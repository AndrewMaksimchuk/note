# HTTP method PUT

The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource
or replaces a representation of the target
resource with the request payload.

The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is
idempotent: calling it once or several times
successively has the same effect (that is no side
effect).

## Example

### Request

```http
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 16

<p>New File</p>
```

### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Location: /new.html

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /existing.html
```
