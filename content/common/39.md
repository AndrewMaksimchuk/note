# HTTP method PATCH

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial
modifications to a resource.

A PATCH request is considered a set of
instructions on how to modify a resource. Contrast
this with PUT; which is a complete representation
of a resource.

A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it
can be. Contrast this with PUT; which is always
idempotent. The word "idempotent" means that any
number of repeated, identical requests will leave
the resource in the same state.

## Example

```http
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/example
If-Match: "e0023aa4e"
Content-Length: 100

[description of changes]
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /file.txt
ETag: "e0023aa4f"
```
