# HTTP method HEAD

The HTTP HEAD method requests the headers that
would be returned if the HEAD request's URL was
instead requested with the HTTP GET method. For
example, if a URL might produce a large download,
a HEAD request could read its Content-Length
header to check the filesize without actually
downloading the file.

```http
HEAD /index.html
```
