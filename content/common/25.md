# Payload body

The HTTP message payload body is the information
("payload") part of the data that is sent in the
HTTP Message Body (if any), prior to *transfer
encoding* being applied. If transfer encoding is
not used, the payload body and message body are
the same!

For example, in this response the message body
contains only the payload body: "Mozilla Developer
Network":

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

Mozilla Developer Network
```

By contrast, the below response uses transfer
encoding to encode the payload body into chunks.
The payload body (information) sent is still
"Mozilla Developer Network", but the message body
includes additional data to separate the chunks:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

7\r\n
Mozilla\r\n
9\r\n
Developer\r\n
7\r\n
Network\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```
