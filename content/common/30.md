# TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is an
important network protocol that lets two hosts
connect and exchange data streams. TCP guarantees
the delivery of data and packets in the same order
as they were sent. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who
were DARPA scientists at the time, designed TCP in
the 1970s.

TCP's role is to ensure the packets are reliably
delivered, and error-free. TCP implements
congestion control, which means the initial
requests start small, increasing in size to the
levels of bandwidth the computers, servers, and
network can support.
