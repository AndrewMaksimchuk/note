# Where should I store the data?  

Typically data is stored in the user’s “app data”  
folder. Where this directory is varies by  
operating system.  

- Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/<Your App  
  Name (taken from the name property in package.json)>  
- Windows: C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\<Your App Name>  
- Linux: ~/.config/<Your App Name>
