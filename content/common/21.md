# Challenge-response authentication

In security protocols, a challenge is some data
sent to the client by the server in order to
generate a different response each time.
Challenge-response protocols are one way to fight
against replay attacks where an attacker listens
to the previous messages and resends them at a
later time to get the same credentials as the
original message.

The HTTP authentication protocol is
challenge-response based, though the "Basic"
protocol isn't using a real challenge (the realm
is always the same).
