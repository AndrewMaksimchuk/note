# Payload header

A payload header is an HTTP header that describes
the payload information related to safe transport
and reconstruction of the original resource
representation, from one or more messages. This
includes information like the length of the
message payload, which part of the resource is
carried in this payload (for a multi-part
message), any encoding applied for transport,
message integrity checks, etc.

Payload headers may be present in both HTTP
request and response messages (i.e. in any message
that is carrying payload data).

The payload headers include: Content-Length,
Content-Range, Trailer, and Transfer-Encoding.
