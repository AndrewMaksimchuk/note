# CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system,
consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that
determines whether browsers block frontend
JavaScript code from accessing responses for
cross-origin requests.

The same-origin security policy forbids
cross-origin access to resources. But CORS gives
web servers the ability to say they want to opt
into allowing cross-origin access to their
resources.
