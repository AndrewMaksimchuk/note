# HTTP method POST

The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The
type of the body of the request is indicated by
the Content-Type header.

## Example

```http
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 27

field1=value1&field2=value2
```

```http
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary="boundary"

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field1"

value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field2"; filename="example.txt"

value2
--boundary--
``` 

- Providing a block of data, such as the fields entered into an HTML form, to a data-handling process;
- Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, blog, or similar group of articles;
- Creating a new resource that has yet to be identified by the origin server; and
- Appending data to a resource's existing representation(s).

If one or more resources has been created on the origin server as a result of successfully processing a POST request, the origin server SHOULD send a 201 (Created) response containing a Location header field that provides an identifier for the primary resource created and a representation that describes the status of the request while referring to the new resource(s).

If the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a representation of an existing resource, an origin server MAY redirect the user agent to that resource by sending a 303 (See Other) response with the existing resource's identifier in the Location field.
