# Function legend()

This function can be used to add legends to plots.

legend(x, y = NULL, legend, fill = NULL, col = par("col"),
            border = "black", lty, lwd, pch,
            angle = 45, density = NULL, bty = "o", bg = par("bg"),
            box.lwd = par("lwd"), box.lty = par("lty"), box.col = par("fg"),
            pt.bg = NA, cex = 1, pt.cex = cex, pt.lwd = lwd,
            xjust = 0, yjust = 1, x.intersp = 1, y.intersp = 1,
            adj = c(0, 0.5), text.width = NULL, text.col = par("col"),
            text.font = NULL, merge = do.lines && has.pch, trace = FALSE,
            plot = TRUE, ncol = 1, horiz = FALSE, title = NULL,
            inset = 0, xpd, title.col = text.col, title.adj = 0.5,
            seg.len = 2)

x, y: the x and y co-ordinates to be used to position the legend.
          They can be specified by keyword or in any way which is
          accepted by ‘xy.coords’: See ‘Details’.

legend: a character or expression vector of length >= 1 to appear in
          the legend.  Other objects will be coerced by
          ‘as.graphicsAnnot’.

inset: inset distance(s) from the margins as a fraction of the plot
          region when legend is placed by keyword.
