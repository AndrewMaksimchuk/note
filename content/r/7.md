# Getting help with functions and features

R has an inbuilt help facility similar to the man facility of UNIX. To get more information on any specific named function, for example solve, the command is 

> help(solve)

An alternative is

> ?solve

For a feature specified by special characters, the argument must be enclosed in double or single quotes, making it a “character string”: This is also necessary for a few words with syntactic meaning including if, for and function.

> help("[[")

The help.search command (alternatively ??) allows searching for help in various ways. For example,

> ??solve

Try ?help.search for details and more examples.

The examples on a help topic can normally be run by

> example(topic)
