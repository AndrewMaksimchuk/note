# SIGTERM and SIGQUIT  

The SIGTERM and SIGQUIT signals are meant to  
terminate the process. In this case, we are  
specifically requesting to finish it. SIGTERM is  
the default signal when we use the kill command.  

The default action of both signals is to terminate  
the process. However, SIGQUIT also generates a  
core dump before exiting.
