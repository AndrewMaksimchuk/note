# Understanding systemd User Services

systemd allows users to create and manage their own services without needing root access. This is particularly useful for running applications that only need to operate under a specific user account.

Key Features of User Services

- User-Specific: User services are linked to a specific user account and are stored in the user's home directory.
- Location: User services are typically found in ~/.config/systemd/user/. This is where you create your service files.
- Startup Behavior: These services start automatically when the user logs in and stop when the user logs out.

## Create the Service file

```
touch ~/.config/systemd/user/myservice.service
```

## Edit the Service File

```
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/application

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

## Enable the Service

systemctl --user enable myservice.service

## Start the Service

systemctl --user start myservice.service

## Check Status

systemctl --user status myservice.service

## Stop the Service

systemctl --user stop myservice.service
