# gdb - The GNU Debugger

The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow  
you to see what is going on "inside" another  
program while it executes -- or what another  
program was doing at the moment it crashed.  

```sh
aliases -- User-defined aliases of other commands.
breakpoints -- Making program stop at certain points.
data -- Examining data.
files -- Specifying and examining files.
internals -- Maintenance commands.
obscure -- Obscure features.
running -- Running the program.
stack -- Examining the stack.
status -- Status inquiries.
support -- Support facilities.
text-user-interface -- TUI is the GDB text based interface.
tracepoints -- Tracing of program execution without stopping the program.
user-defined -- User-defined commands.
```
