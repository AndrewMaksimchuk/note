# sdiff - side-by-side merge of file differences

Like `diff` but using the vertical bar symbol on  
that line.   

```sh
$ sdiff one.rs two.rs
fn main() {                        fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");          println!("Hello world!");
    println!("Exiting...");      |     println!("Exiting..");
}                                  }
```
