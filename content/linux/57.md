# Terminal pager

A terminal pager, paging program or simply pager is a computer program used to view (but not modify) the contents of a text file moving down the file one line or one screen at a time.
A pager is a tool for displaying the contents of files or other output on the terminal, in a user friendly way, across several screens if needed.

## Default pager

The default pager can be configured by setting the PAGER environment variable, and similarly, the default manpager can be configured by setting the MANPAGER environment variable:

```.bashrc
PAGER="less"
MANPAGER="less"
```

## Use neovim as man pager

```.bashrc
MANPAGER='nvim +Man!'
```
