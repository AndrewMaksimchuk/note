# Switching to fish  

If you wish to use fish as your default shell,  
use the following command:  
```
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```
Use the following command if fish isnâ€™t already  
added to /etc/shells to permit fish to be your  
login shell:  
```
echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
```
To switch your default shell back, you can run  
`chsh -s /bin/bash` (substituting `/bin/bash`  
with `/bin/tcsh` or `/bin/zsh` as appropriate).
