# core - core dump file  

The  default action of certain signals is to cause  
a process to terminate and produce a core dump  
file, a file containing an im‚Äêage of the process's  
memory at the time of termination. This image can  
be used in a debugger to  inspect the state  of  
the program at the time that it terminated.
