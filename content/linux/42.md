# cron

Cron runs in an environment that knows nothing  
about the display manager ($DISPLAY isn't set).  
Your terminal window that you've been testing in  
has this set for it.  

If you've only got one X server running, just  
specifying the display might work:  

```crontab
* * * * *    DISPLAY=:0 firefox ...
* * * * *    WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 GNOME_SETUP_DISPLAY=:1 DISPLAY=:0 firefox ...
```
