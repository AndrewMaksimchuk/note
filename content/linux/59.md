# pass - stores, retrieves, generates, and synchronizes passwords securely

`pass`  is  a  very  simple  password  store  that  keeps passwords inside `gpg2(1)` encrypted files inside a simple directory tree residing at 
~/.password-store.  The pass utility provides a series of commands for manipulating the password store, allowing the user to  add,  remove, 
edit, synchronize, generate, and manipulate passwords.

## Example

### Initialize password store

  zx2c4@laptop ~ $ pass init Jason@zx2c4.com
  mkdir: created directory ‘/home/zx2c4/.password-store’
