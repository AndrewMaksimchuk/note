# Void element

A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.

## The void elements in HTML are as follows:
- <area>
- <base>
- <br>
- <col>
- <embed>
- <hr>
- <img>
- <input>
- <link>
- <meta>
- <param> Deprecated
- <source>
- <track>
- <wbr>

## Self-closing tags (<tag />) do not exist in HTML.

Self-closing tags are required in void elements in XML, XHTML, and SVG (e.g., <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />).  
In SVG and MathML, elements that cannot have any child nodes are allowed to be marked as self-closing. In such cases, if an element's start tag is marked as self-closing, the element must not have an end tag.
