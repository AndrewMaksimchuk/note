# Tag <code>

Defines a piece of computer code

## Example

```html
<p>
Way back in 1994, someone at Netscape (one of the
original web browsers) had the not-so-bright idea that
text that blinked on and off would be a good thing. Thus
the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag — the most reviled tag
of all time — was born.
</p>
```

If your code includes a variable name, you can 
mark up that name semantically using the var (for 
“variable”) element:

```html
Given positive values of the variables <var>x</var> and
<var>y</var>, what is the price of tea in China?
```
