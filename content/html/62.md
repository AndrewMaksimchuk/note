Checking out the source code of a web page isn't
normally a "fun" experience. Most often, your goal is to get
the name of a file or to figure out how the site
performed some HTML or CSS magic. But every once in a
very long while you can find a surprise, even a
delightful one, waiting in the source code. As shown in
Figure 1, I came across one such surprise the other day
while viewing source on a page from <i>The Guardian</i>.
