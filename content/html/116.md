# Replaced elements

Replaced elements in HTML are elements whose content is provided by external resources, meaning their display is independent of the CSS styles applied to the surrounding document. Common examples include <img>, <video>, <iframe>, and <embed>, which do not inherit styles from their parent elements.

A replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; they're external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model. Some replaced elements, such as <iframe> elements, may have stylesheets of their own, but they don't inherit the styles of the parent document.

While document styles can set the size and position of replaced elements, document styles dont affect the replaced elements' content, with some exceptions: The CSS images module includes properties which support controlling the positioning of the element's content within its box.

## The following can be replaced elements:
- <img>
- <video>
- <iframe>
- <embed>
- <fencedframe>

## The following are treated as replaced elements only in specific cases:
- <audio>
- <canvas>
- <object>
- <input> (image input types only)

Replaced elements often have an intrinsic dimensions and intrinsic ratio. For example, the content of an <img> element is generally replaced by the image defined by its src attribute. That image has an intrinsic width and an intrinsic height specified in absolute units, which determines the aspect ratio.

Form controls are generally non-replaced widgets, except for <input type="image">, which is replaced with an image. Objects inserted using the CSS content property are anonymous replaced elements. They are "anonymous" because they don't exist in the HTML markup.
