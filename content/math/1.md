# Boolean algebra

## Basic operations

Has only three basic operations: conjunction, disjunction, and negation, 
expressed with the corresponding binary operators AND ( ∧ or ⋅ ) 
and OR ( ∨ or + ) and the unary operator NOT ( ¬ or ∼ )

## Secondary operations

Material conditional: 	x → y = ¬ x ∨ y 
Material biconditional: x ↔ y = ( x ∧ y ) ∨ ( ¬ x ∧ ¬ y ) = ( x ∨ ¬ y ) ∧ ( ¬ x ∨ y )
Exclusive OR (XOR): 	x ⊕ y = ¬ ( x ↔ y ) = ( x ∨ y ) ∧ ¬ ( x ∧ y ) = ( x ∨ y ) ∧ ( ¬ x ∨ ¬ y ) = ( x ∧ ¬ y ) ∨ ( ¬ x ∧ y ) 

XOR Operation	⊕	Returns true if exactly one input is true.
NAND Operation	↓	Returns false only if both inputs are true.
NOR Operation	↑	Returns false if at least one input is true.
XNOR Operation	↔	Returns true if both inputs are equal.
