git switch  

Switch to a specified branch. The working tree  
and the index are updated to match the branch.  
All new commits will be added to the tip of this  
branch.  

Switching branches does not require a clean index  
and working tree (i.e. no differences compared to  
HEAD).  

-c <new-branch>
--create <new-branch>
Create a new branch named <new-branch> starting at  
<start-point> before switching to the branch. This  
is a convenient shortcut for:  
```
$ git branch <new-branch>
$ git switch <new-branch>
```

Examples  
You can grow a new branch from any commit. For  
example, switch to "HEAD~3" and create branch  
"fixup":  
```
$ git switch -c fixup HEAD~3
Switched to a new branch 'fixup'
```
If you want to start a new branch from a remote  
branch of the same name:  
```
$ git switch new-topic
Branch 'new-topic' set up to track remote branch 'new-topic' from 'origin'
Switched to a new branch 'new-topic'
```
If it turns out whatever you have done is worth  
keeping, you can always create a new name for it  
(without switching away):  
```
$ git switch -c good-surprises
```
