# git add -p, --patch

Interactively choose hunks of patch between the  
index and the work tree and add them to the  
index. This gives the user a chance to review the  
difference before adding modified contents to the  
index.  

This effectively runs add --interactive, but  
bypasses the initial command menu and directly  
jumps to the patch subcommand. See “Interactive  
mode” for details.  

`patch`  
This lets you choose one path out of a status  
like selection. After choosing the path, it  
presents the diff between the index and the  
working tree file and asks you if you want to  
stage the change of each hunk. You can select one  
of the following options and type return:  

y - stage this hunk
n - do not stage this hunk
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
g - select a hunk to go to
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
e - manually edit the current hunk
? - print help
