# git log -S<string>

Look for differences that change the number of  
occurrences of the specified string (i.e.  
addition/deletion) in a file. Intended for the  
scripter’s use.  

It is useful when you’re looking for an exact  
block of code (like a struct), and want to know  
the history of that block since it first came  
into being: use the feature iteratively to feed  
the interesting block in the preimage back into  
`-S`, and keep going until you get the very first  
version of the block.  

Binary files are searched as well.
