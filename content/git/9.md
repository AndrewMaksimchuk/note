git rebase  
INTERACTIVE MODE  

Rebasing interactively means that you have a  
chance to edit the commits which are rebased. You  
can reorder the commits, and you can remove them.  

Start it with the last commit you want to  
retain as-is:  
```sh
git rebase -i <after-this-commit>
```
An editor will be fired up with all the commits in  
your current branch (ignoring merge commits),  
which come after the given commit.  

By replacing the command "pick" with the command  
"edit", you can tell git rebase to stop after  
applying that commit, so that you can edit the  
files and/or the commit message, amend the commit,  
and continue rebasing.  

If you just want to edit the commit message for a  
commit, replace the command "pick" with the  
command "reword".  

To drop a commit, replace the command "pick" with  
"drop", or just delete the matching line.  

If you want to fold two or more commits into one,  
replace the command "pick" for the second and  
subsequent commits with "squash" or "fixup".  

When you are done editing and/or resolving  
conflicts you can continue with  
`git rebase --continue`.  

For example, if you want to reorder the last 5  
commits, such that what was HEAD~4 becomes the  
new HEAD. To achieve that, you would call git  
rebase like this:  
```
$ git rebase -i HEAD~5
```
