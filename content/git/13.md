# git reset

git-reset - Reset current HEAD to the specified  
            state  

git reset [<mode>] [<commit>]  

This form resets the current branch head to  
<commit> and possibly updates the index (resetting  
it to the tree of <commit>) and the working tree  
depending on <mode>. Before the operation,  
ORIG_HEAD is set to the tip of the current branch.  
If <mode> is omitted, defaults to --mixed. The  
<mode> must be one of the following:  

--soft  
Does not touch the index file or the working tree  
at all (but resets the head to <commit>, just like  
all modes do). This leaves all your changed files  
"Changes to be committed", as git status would put  
it.  

--mixed
Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e.,  
the changed files are preserved but not marked for  
commit) and reports what has not been updated.  
This is the default action.  

--hard
Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to  
tracked files in the working tree since <commit>  
are discarded. Any untracked files or directories  
in the way of writing any tracked files are simply  
deleted.  

--merge  
--keep
