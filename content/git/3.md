# Forget about a file that was tracked, but is now in .gitignore?  

To stop tracking a file, we must remove  
it from the index:  

```sh
git rm --cached <file>
```

To remove a folder and all files in  
the folder recursively:  

```sh
git rm -r --cached <folder>
```

The removal of the file from the head  
revision will happen on the next commit.
