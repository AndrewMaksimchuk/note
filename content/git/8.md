# git-rebase

git-rebase - Reapply commits on top of another  
             base tip  

Assume the following history exists and the  
current branch is "topic":  

```
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master
```
From this point, the result of either of the  
following commands:  

```sh
git rebase master
git rebase master topic
```

would be:  
```
                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master
```
