# window.matchMedia()  

The Window interface's matchMedia() method returns  
a new MediaQueryList object that can then be used  
to determine if the document matches the media  
query string.  

```javascript
let mql = window.matchMedia("(max-width: 600px)");
window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');
```

Return value:  
A new "MediaQueryList" object for the media query.  
Use this object's properties and events to detect  
matches and to monitor for changes to those  
matches over time.  

MediaQueryList properties:  
- matches Read only
  A boolean value that returns true if the 
  document currently matches the media query 
  list, or false if not.
- media Read only
  A string representing a serialized media query.
