# DataView

The DataView view provides a low-level interface
for reading and writing multiple number types in a
binary ArrayBuffer, without having to care about
the platform's endianness.

## Example

```javascript
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);
const view = new DataView(buffer, 0);

view.setInt16(1, 42);
view.getInt16(1); // 42
```
