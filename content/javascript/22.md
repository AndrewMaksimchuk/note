# Object.seal()

The Object.seal() static method seals an object.  
Sealing an object prevents extensions and makes  
existing properties non-configurable. A sealed  
object has a fixed set of properties: new  
properties cannot be added, existing properties  
cannot be removed, their enumerability and  
configurability cannot be changed, and its  
prototype cannot be re-assigned. Values of  
existing properties can still be changed as long  
as they are writable. seal() returns the same  
object that was passed in.  
```
const object1 = {
  property1: 42
};

Object.seal(object1);
object1.property1 = 33;
console.log(object1.property1);
// Expected output: 33

delete object1.property1; // Cannot delete when sealed
console.log(object1.property1);
// Expected output: 33
```
