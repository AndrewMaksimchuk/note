The Object.preventExtensions() static method  
prevents new properties from ever being added to  
an object (i.e. prevents future extensions to the  
object). It also prevents the object's prototype  
from being re-assigned.  
```
const object1 = {};

Object.preventExtensions(object1);

try {
  Object.defineProperty(object1, 'property1', {
    value: 42
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
  // Expected output: TypeError: Cannot define property property1, object is not extensible
}
```
