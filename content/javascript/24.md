# Array.prototype.sort()  

If compareFn is supplied, all non-undefined array  
elements are sorted according to the return value  
of the compare function (all undefined elements  
are sorted to the end of the array, with no call  
to compareFn).  

| compareFn(a, b) | return value 	  | sort order |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------|
| > 0 	          | sort a after b, e.g.  | [b, a]     |
| < 0 	          | sort a before b, e.g. | [a, b]     |
| === 0 	  | keep original order of a and b |   |
