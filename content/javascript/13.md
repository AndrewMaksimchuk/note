# Static method Object.freeze()

The Object.freeze() static method freezes an  
object. Freezing an object prevents extensions and  
makes existing properties non-writable and  
non-configurable. A frozen object can no longer  
be changed: new properties cannot be added,  
existing properties cannot be removed, their  
enumerability, configurability, writability, or  
value cannot be changed, and the object's  
prototype cannot be re-assigned. freeze() returns  
the same object that was passed in.  

Freezing an object is the highest integrity level  
that JavaScript provides.  

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 42
};

Object.freeze(obj);

obj.prop = 33;
// Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop);
// Expected output: 42
```
