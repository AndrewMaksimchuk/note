# Built-in Special Attributes `key`

The key special attribute is primarily used as a  
hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify  
vnodes when diffing the new list of nodes against  
the old list.   

Children of the same common parent must have  
**unique keys**  

```vue template
<ul>
  <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">...</li>
</ul>
```
