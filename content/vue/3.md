# Composables  

In the context of Vue applications, a "composable"  
is a function that leverages Vue's Composition API  
to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.  

``` js
// mouse.js
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

// by convention, composable function names start with "use"
export function useMouse() {
  // state encapsulated and managed by the composable
  const x = ref(0)
  const y = ref(0)

  // a composable can update its managed state over time.
  function update(event) {
    x.value = event.pageX
    y.value = event.pageY
  }

  // a composable can also hook into its owner component's
  // lifecycle to setup and teardown side effects.
  onMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))
  onUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))

  // expose managed state as return value
  return { x, y }
}

<script setup>
import { useMouse } from './mouse.js'

const { x, y } = useMouse()
</script>

<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>
```
