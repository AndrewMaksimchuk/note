# ref()

Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and  
mutable ref object, which has a single property  
`.value` that points to the inner value.  

If an object is assigned as a ref's value, the  
object is made deeply reactive with reactive().  
This also means if the object contains nested  
refs, they will be deeply unwrapped.  

To avoid the deep conversion, use `shallowRef()`  
instead.  

```js
const count = ref(0)
console.log(count.value) // 0

count.value = 1
console.log(count.value) // 1
```
