# Built-in Components <Transition>

Provides animated transition effects to a single  
element or component.   

```vue
<Transition name="fade" mode="out-in" appear>
  <component :is="view"></component>
</Transition>
```

Vue provides us with the built-in <Transition> component in cases where we want to animate an element as it is removed from, or added to, our application with v-if or v-show, because that would be hard to do with plain CSS animation.

## The Six <Transition> Classes

There are six classes automatically available to us when we use the <Transition> component.

As an element inside the <Transition> component is added, we can use these first three classes to animate that transition:
v-enter-from
v-enter-active
v-enter-to

And as an element is removed inside the <Transition> component, we can use the next three classes :
v-leave-from
v-leave-active
v-leave-to

^Note: There can only be one element on root level of the <Transition> component.

We can also use the v-enter-active and v-leave-active to set styling or animation during adding or during removal of an element:

```vue
<template>
  <h1>Add/Remove <p> Tag</h1>
  <button @click="this.exists = !this.exists">{{btnText}}</button><br>
  <Transition>
    <p v-if="exists">Hello World!</p>
  </Transition>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      exists: false
    }
  },
  computed: {
    btnText() {
      if(this.exists) {
        return 'Remove';
      }
      else {
        return 'Add';
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style>
  .v-enter-active {
    background-color: lightgreen;
    animation: added 1s;
  }
  .v-leave-active {
    background-color: lightcoral;
    animation: added 1s reverse;
  }
  @keyframes added {
    from {
      opacity: 0;
      translate: -100px 0;
    }
    to {
      opacity: 1;
      translate: 0 0;
    }
  }
  p {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 10px;
    border: dashed black 1px;
  }
</style>
```

## The Transition 'name' Prop

```vue
<Transition name="swirl">
```

If the transition name prop value is set to 'swirl', the automatically available classes will now start with 'swirl-' instead of 'v-':
swirl-enter-from
swirl-enter-active
swirl-enter-to
swirl-leave-from
swirl-leave-active
swirl-leave-to

## JavaScript Transition Hooks

Transition Class 	JavaScript Event
v-enter-from     	before-enter
v-enter-active  	enter
v-enter-to 	        after-enter
                    enter-cancelled
v-leave-from 	    before-leave
v-leave-active 	    leave
v-leave-to 	        after-leave
                    leave-cancelled (v-show only)

```vue
  <Transition @after-enter="onAfterEnter">
    <p v-show="pVisible" id="p1">Hello World!</p>
  </Transition>
```

## The 'appear' Prop

If we have an element that we want to animate when the page loads, we need to use the appear prop on the <Transition> component.

```vue
  <Transition appear>
    <p id="p1">Hello World!</p>
  </Transition>
```

## mode="out-in"

We use the mode="out-in" prop and prop value on the <Transition> component so that the removal of an element is finished before the next element is added.

```vue
<template>
  <h1>mode="out-in"</h1>
  <p>Click the button to get a new image.</p>
  <p>With mode="out-in", the next image is not added until the current image is removed. Another difference from the previous example, is that here we use computed prop instead of a method.</p>
  <button @click="indexNbr++">Next image</button><br>
  <Transition mode="out-in">
    <img src="/img_pizza.svg" v-if="imgActive === 'pizza'">
    <img src="/img_apple.svg" v-else-if="imgActive === 'apple'">
    <img src="/img_cake.svg" v-else-if="imgActive === 'cake'">
    <img src="/img_fish.svg" v-else-if="imgActive === 'fish'">
    <img src="/img_rice.svg" v-else-if="imgActive === 'rice'">
  </Transition>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      imgs: ['pizza', 'apple', 'cake', 'fish', 'rice'],
      indexNbr: 0
    }
  },
  computed: {
    imgActive() {
      if(this.indexNbr >= this.imgs.length) {
        this.indexNbr = 0;
      }
      return this.imgs[this.indexNbr];
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style>
  .v-enter-active {
    animation: swirlAdded 0.7s;
  }
  .v-leave-active {
    animation: swirlAdded 0.7s reverse;
  }
  @keyframes swirlAdded {
    from {
      opacity: 0;
      rotate: 0;
      scale: 0.1;
    }
    to {
      opacity: 1;
      rotate: 360deg;
      scale: 1;
    }
  }
  img {
    width: 100px;
    margin: 20px;
  }
  img:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
</style>
```
