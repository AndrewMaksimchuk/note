# app.use()

Installs a plugin.  
```ts
interface App {
  use(plugin: Plugin, ...options: any[]): this
}
```

The plugin can either be an object with an  
`install()` method, or just a function that will  
be used as the `install()` method.  

When app.use() is called on the same plugin  
multiple times, the plugin will be installed  
only once.  

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import MyPlugin from './plugins/MyPlugin'

const app = createApp({
  /* ... */
})

app.use(MyPlugin)
```
