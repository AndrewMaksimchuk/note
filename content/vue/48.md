# Namespaced Components

You can use component tags with dots like  
<Foo.Bar> to refer to components nested under  
object properties. This is useful when you import  
multiple components from a single file:   

```vue
<script setup>
import * as Form from './form-components'
</script>

<template>
  <Form.Input>
    <Form.Label>label</Form.Label>
  </Form.Input>
</template>
```
