# v-text

`v-text` works by setting the element's  
textContent property, so it will overwrite any  
existing content inside the element. If you need  
to update the part of textContent, you should use  
mustache interpolations instead.  

```js
<span v-text="msg"></span>
<!-- same as -->
<span>{{msg}}</span>
```
