# Function reactive()

Returns a reactive proxy of the object.  

```ts
function reactive<T extends object>(target: T): UnwrapNestedRefs<T>
```

The reactive conversion is "deep": it affects all  
nested properties. A reactive object also deeply  
unwraps any properties that are refs while  
maintaining reactivity.  

## Creating a reactive object:
```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })
obj.count++
```
