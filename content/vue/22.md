# app.config.globalProperties

An object that can be used to register global  
properties that can be accessed on any component  
instance inside the application.  

```ts
interface AppConfig {
  globalProperties: Record<string, any>
}
```

If a global property conflicts with a componentâ€™s  
own property, the component's own property will  
have higher priority.  

```js
app.config.globalProperties.msg = 'hello'
```

This makes msg available inside any component  
template in the application, and also on this of  
any component instance:  
```js
export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log(this.msg) // 'hello'
  }
}
```
