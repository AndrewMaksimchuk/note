# Functions useSlots() & useAttrs()

Usage of slots and attrs inside `<script setup>`  
should be relatively rare, since you can access  
them directly as $slots and $attrs in the  
template.   

```vue
<script setup>
import { useSlots, useAttrs } from 'vue'

const slots = useSlots()
const attrs = useAttrs()
</script>
```
