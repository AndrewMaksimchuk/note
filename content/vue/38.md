# Built-in Components <KeepAlive>

Caches dynamically toggled components wrapped  
inside.   

When wrapped around a dynamic component,  
`<KeepAlive>` caches the inactive component  
instances without destroying them.  

There can only be one active component instance  
as the direct child of <KeepAlive> at any time.  

```vue
<KeepAlive>
  <component :is="view"></component>
</KeepAlive>

<KeepAlive>
  <comp-a v-if="a > 1"></comp-a>
  <comp-b v-else></comp-b>
</KeepAlive>

<Transition>
  <KeepAlive>
    <component :is="view"></component>
  </KeepAlive>
</Transition>
```
