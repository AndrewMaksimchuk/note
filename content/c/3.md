# execve - execute program  

execve() executes the program referred to by pathname.  This
causes the program that is currently being run by the calling
process to be replaced with a new program, with newly initialized
stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.

pathname must be either a binary executable, or a script starting
with a line of the form: #!interpreter [optional-arg]
