# Preprocessor Conditional Compilation

To use conditional, `#ifdef`,`#if`, `#defined`,  
`#else` and #elif directives are used.   

## #ifdef Directive

```c
#ifdef MACRO     
   // conditional codes
#endif
```

## #if, #elif and #else Directive

```c
#if expression
   // conditional codes
#endif
```

Here, expression is an expression of integer type  
(can be integers, characters, arithmetic  
expression, macros, and so on).  

The conditional codes are included in the program  
only if the expression is evaluated to a non-zero  
value.  

The optional #else directive can be used with #if  
directive.  

```c
#if expression
   conditional codes if expression is non-zero
#else
   conditional if expression is 0
#endif

#if expression
    // conditional codes if expression is non-zero
#elif expression1
    // conditional codes if expression is non-zero
#elif expression2
    // conditional codes if expression is non-zero
#else
    // conditional if all expressions are 0
#endif
```

## #defined

```c
#if defined BUFFER_SIZE && BUFFER_SIZE >= 2048
  // codes
```

The special operator #defined is used to test  
whether a certain macro is defined or not. It's  
often used with #if directive.
