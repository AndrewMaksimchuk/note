# Function Definitions

We have already presented many examples of function definitions. To summarize the rules, a function definition looks like this:

returntype
functionname (parm_declarationsâ€¦)
{
  body
}

The part before the open-brace is called the function header.

Write void as the returntype if the function does not return a value.
