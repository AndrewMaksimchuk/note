# C++ Named Operators

In C++, there are eleven keywords which are simply alternate spellings of operators normally
written with punctuation. These keywords are treated as such even in the preprocessor.
They function as operators in ‘#if’, and they cannot be defined as macros or poisoned. In
C, you can request that those keywords take their C++ meaning by including iso646.h.
That header defines each one as a normal object-like macro expanding to the appropriate
punctuator.

These are the named operators and their corresponding punctuators:

xor             ^
xor_eq          ^=
