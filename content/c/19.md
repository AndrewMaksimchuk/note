# NULL - null pointer constant

## SYNOPSIS

\#include <stddef.h>
\#define NULL  ((void *) 0)

## DESCRIPTION

NULL represents a null pointer constant, that is, a pointer that does not point to anything.

## CAVEATS

It is undefined behavior to dereference a null pointer, and that usually causes a segmentation fault in practice.
It is also undefined behavior to perform pointer arithmetic on it.
NULL - NULL is undefined behavior, according to ISO C, but is defined to be 0 in C++.
To avoid confusing human readers of the code, do not compare pointer variables to 0, and do not assign 0 to them. Instead, always use NULL.
NULL shouldn't be confused with NUL, which is an ascii(7) character, represented in C as '\0'.
