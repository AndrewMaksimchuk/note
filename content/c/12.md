# gcc option -l

`-llibrary` - Search the library named `library`  
when linking.   

The linker searches a standard list of  
directories for the library. The directories  
searched include several standard system  
directories plus any that you specify with -L.  

It makes a difference where in the command you  
write this option; the linker searches and  
processes libraries and object files in the order  
they are specified.  Thus, foo.o -lz bar.o  
searches library z after file foo.o but before  
bar.o.  If bar.o refers to functions in z, those  
functions may not be loaded.
