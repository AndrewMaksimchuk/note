# Pseudo-class :focus

The `:focus` CSS pseudo-class represents an element  
(such as a form input) that has received focus. It  
is generally triggered when the user clicks or  
taps on an element or selects it with the  
keyboard's Tab key.  

```css
input:focus {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

select:focus {
  background-color: ivory;
}

.red-input:focus {
  background: yellow;
  color: red;
}
```
