# Property flex-shrink

Specifies how the item will shrink relative to  
the rest.

The `flex-shrink` sets the shrink factor of a  
flex item. If the size of all flex items is  
larger than the wrapper, items will shrink  
according to the `flex-shrink` factor.

## Example

This will allow the item to shrink in width if  
there is no space available to fit all flex  
items.

```css
.item-2 {
  width: 300px;
  flex-shrink: 1;
}
```
