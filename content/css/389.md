# The currentColor Keyword

The `currentColor` holds the value of an element’s  
color property.

It can be used on elements that don’t inherit
color by default. Here are some properties that
default to `currentColor`:  
- border-color
- text-decoration-color
- outline-color
- box-shadow

An interesting thing to know about the  
`currentColor` is that it can be used on the parent  
element level, or for the child elements.

```html
<h1>
  This is a title
  <span>I'm a child element</span>
</h1>
```

```css
h1 {
  color: #222;
  background-color: currentColor;
}
```
