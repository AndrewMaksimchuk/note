# Pseudo-element ::before

p::before
Insert something before the content of each <p>  
element.

`::before` creates a pseudo-element that is the  
first child of the selected element. It is often  
used to add cosmetic content to an element with  
the content property. It is inline by default.

If the content property is not specified, has an  
invalid value, or has normal or none as a value,  
then the `::before` pseudo-element is not rendered.  
It behaves as if display: none is set.

## Examples

```css
q::before {
  content: "«";
  color: blue;
}

q::after {
  content: "»";
  color: red;
}

li {
  padding: 0.5em;
}

li[aria-current="step"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

li[aria-current="step"]::after {
  content: " \21E6"; /* Hexadecimal for Unicode Leftwards white arrow*/
  display: inline;
}
```
