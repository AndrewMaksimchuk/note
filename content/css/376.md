# prefers-color-scheme  

The prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature is used  
to detect if a user has requested light or dark  
color themes. A user indicates their preference  
through an operating system setting (e.g. light or  
dark mode) or a user agent setting.  

```css
.theme-a {
  background: #dca;
  color: #731;
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .theme-a.adaptive {
    background: #753;
    color: #dcb;
    outline: 5px dashed #000;
  }
}
```
