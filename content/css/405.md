# Combining type and class selectors

When you use a selector such as .subtitle in a CSS rule, you’re asking the browser
to match every page element that uses the subtitle class. However, suppose your
page uses that class not only in all its h2 elements, but all its h3 elements as well.
How can you target just those h3 elements that use the subtitle class? By pre-
ceding the class selector with the element name:

```css
element.class-name {
	property1: value1;
	property2: value2;
}
```

For example, the following rule matches just the
h3 elements that have the sub-title class:

```css
h3.subtitle {
	border: 2px dashed royalblue;
}
```

## Matching multiple classes

It’s possible (in fact, fairly common) for an
element to have two or more classes. To add
multiple classes to a tag, you still use the class
attribute, but in the value, you separate each
class name with a space. Here’s an example:

```css
<h4 class="subtitle aside-title">
```

You can then target any elements that contain both
classes by chaining the class selectors together,
like so:

```css
.subtitle.aside-title {
	color: red;
}
```
