# Selector pseudo-class :root  

The :root CSS pseudo-class matches the root  
element of a tree representing the document. In  
HTML, :root represents the <html> element and is  
identical to the selector html, except that its  
specificity is higher.  

`:root` can be useful for declaring global CSS  
variables:  

```css
:root {
  --main-color: hotpink;
  --pane-padding: 5px 42px;
}
```
