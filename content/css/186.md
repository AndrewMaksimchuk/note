# Property padding

A shorthand property for all the padding-*  
properties

## Implementing aspect-ratio

When an element has a vertical percentage  
padding, it will be based on its parent width.

When the headline has `padding-top: 50%`, the  
value is computed based on its parent width.  
Since the width of the parent is `200px`, the  
`padding-top` will become `100px`.

```html
<article class="card">
  <div class="card__thumb">
    <img src="thumb.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <h3>Muffins Recipe</h3>
    <p>Servings: 3</p>
  </div>
</article>
```

```css
.card__thumb {
  position: relative;
  padding-top: 75%;
}

.card__thumb img {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

With the above, weâ€™ve defined that the height of  
the card thumbnail wrapper (.card__thumb) depends  
on its width. Also, the image is absolutely  
positioned and it has the full width and height  
of its parent, with object-fit: cover for cases  
of uploading a different-sized image.
