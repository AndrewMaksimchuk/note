# Property color-scheme  

The color-scheme CSS property allows an element  
to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably  
be rendered in.  

Adapting to color schemes  
To opt the entire page into the user's color  
scheme preferences declare color-scheme on the  
:root element.  
``` css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
```
