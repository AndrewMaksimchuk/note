elements with platform-specific styling, based on  
the operating system's theme.

appearance: auto;
appearance: menulist-button;
appearance: textfield;

/* Global values */

appearance: initial;
appearance: revert;
appearance: revert-layer;
appearance: unset;

/* <compat-auto> values have the same effect as 'auto' */

appearance: checkbox;
```
