# Pseudo-class `:not()`

The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements  
that do not match a list of selectors. Since it  
prevents specific items from being selected, it is  
known as the negation pseudo-class.  

```css
p:not(.irrelevant) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

p > :not(strong, b.important) {
  color: darkmagenta;
}

/* <p> elements that don't have a class `.fancy` */
p:not(.fancy) {
  color: green;
}

/* Elements that are not <div>s or `.fancy` */
body :not(div):not(.fancy) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Elements that are not <div>s or `.fancy` */
body :not(div, .fancy) {
  text-decoration: overline underline;
}

/* Elements inside an <h2> that aren't a <span> with a class of `.foo` */
h2 :not(span.foo) {
  color: red;
}
```
