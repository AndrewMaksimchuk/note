# Property box-sizing

Defines how the width and height of an element  
are calculated: should they include padding and  
borders, or not.

By default in the CSS box model, the width and  
height you assign to an element is applied only  
to the element's content box.

## Syntax

```css
box-sizing: border-box;
box-sizing: content-box;

/* Global values */
box-sizing: inherit;
box-sizing: initial;
box-sizing: revert;
box-sizing: revert-layer;
box-sizing: unset;
```

## Values

- `content-box` 
  This is the initial and default value as
specified by the CSS standard. The width and
height properties include the content, but does
not include the padding, border, or margin. For
example, .box {width: 350px; border: 10px solid
black;} renders a box that is 370px wide.
  Here, the dimensions of the element are
calculated as: width = width of the content, and
height = height of the content. (Borders and
padding are not included in the calculation.

- `border-box`
  The width and height properties include the
content, padding, and border, but do not include
the margin. Note that padding and border will be
inside of the box. For example, .box {width:
350px; border: 10px solid black;} renders a box
that is 350px wide, with the area for content
being 330px wide. The content box can't be
negative and is floored to 0, making it impossible
to use border-box to make the element disappear.
  Here the dimensions of the element are
calculated as: width = border + padding + width of
the content, and height = border + padding +
height of the content.

## Examples

```html
<div class="content-box">Content box</div>
<br />
<div class="border-box">Border box</div>
```

```css
div {
  width: 160px;
  height: 80px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 8px solid red;
  background: yellow;
}

.content-box {
  box-sizing: content-box;
  /* Total width: 160px + (2 * 20px) + (2 * 8px) = 216px
     Total height: 80px + (2 * 20px) + (2 * 8px) = 136px
     Content box width: 160px
     Content box height: 80px */
}

.border-box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  /* Total width: 160px
     Total height: 80px
     Content box width: 160px - (2 * 20px) - (2 * 8px) = 104px
     Content box height: 80px - (2 * 20px) - (2 * 8px) = 24px */
}
```
