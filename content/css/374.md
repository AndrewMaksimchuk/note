:only-child

The :only-child CSS pseudo-class represents an  
element without any siblings. This is the same as  
:first-child:last-child or :nth-child(1):nth-last-child(1),  
but with a lower specificity.  

```css
li:only-child {
  color: fuchsia;
}

b:only-child {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
