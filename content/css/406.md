# Use CSS hex code colors with alpha values 

## Adding an Alpha Value to CSS Hex Codes

Using an alpha value to update a colorâ€™s
transparency will change the hex code format from
#RRGGBB to #RRGGBBAA (where alpha is A).

The AA value in #RRGGBBAA can range from the
lowest value possible (00) to the highest value
possible (FF). Lowering the value will cause the
visibility to become fainter and fainter until it
becomes transparent. Raising the value will cause
the visibility to become more and more opaque.

```css
div {
  background-color: #0080FF80;
}
```
