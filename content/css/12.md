# Type <length>: `ch`  

Represents the width or more precisely the advance measure of the  
glyph 0 (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the element's font.  
In cases where it is impossible or impractical to determine the  
measure of the 0 glyph, it must be assumed to be 0.5em wide by  
1em tall.
