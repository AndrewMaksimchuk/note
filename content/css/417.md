# Type (tag name) selector

A type selector is the name of a document language element type, and represents an instance of that element type in the document tree.

## Example

For example, the selector h1 represents an h1 element in the document.

A type selector is written as a CSS qualified name: an identifier with an optional namespace prefix.
