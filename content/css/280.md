# Property flex-grow

Specifies how much the item will grow  
relative to the rest.

The value of flex-grow only accepts an integer  
number.

The flex items width will with `flex-grow: 1`  
being used, the available space was distributed  
between them.

Since the `flex-grow` property accepts integer  
values, it’s possible to use `0` as a way to  
prevent a flex item from taking the available  
space.

## Flex grow doesn’t make flex items equal

There is a common misconception that using  
`flex-grow` will make the items equal in width.  
*This is incorrect*. The idea of using  
`flex-grow` is to distribute the available space.

## Example

```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```
