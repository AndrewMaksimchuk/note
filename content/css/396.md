# The ::backdrop CSS pseudo-element

Is a box the size of the viewport, which is
rendered immediately beneath any element being
presented in the top layer.

## Examples

```css
/* Backdrop is only displayed when dialog is opened with dialog.showModal() */
dialog::backdrop {
  background: rgb(255 0 0 / 25%);
}

video::backdrop {
  background-color: #448;
}
```
