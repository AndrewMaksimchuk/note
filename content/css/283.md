# Property flex-basis

Specifies the initial length of a flexible item.

If you want to make the flex items equal in  
width, it’s possible by using `flex-basis`.

The `flex-basis` property can accept the same  
values as the `width` or `height` properties. The  
default value is `auto`, which resolves to  
content. The `content` value is an automatic  
size based on the flex item content size.

```css
.item-1 {
  flex-grow: 0;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
```

It’s important to reset the `flex-grow` to `0` to  
prevent the item from becoming larger than 50%.
