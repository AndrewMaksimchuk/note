# Property text-transform

Controls the capitalization of text

## Values

- none
    No effects. 

- capitalize
    Puts the first typographic letter unit of each word, if lowercase, in titlecase; other characters are unaffected. 
- uppercase
    Puts all letters in uppercase. 

- lowercase
    Puts all letters in lowercase. 

- full-width
    Puts all typographic character units in full-width form. If a character does not have a corresponding full-width form, it is left as is. This value is typically used to typeset Latin letters and digits as if they were ideographic characters. 

- full-size-kana
    Converts all small Kana characters to the equivalent full-size Kana. This value is typically used for ruby annotation text, where authors may want all small Kana to be drawn as large Kana to compensate for legibility issues at the small font sizes typically used in ruby. 

- math-auto
    See MathML Core § 4.2 New text-transform value.
