Modules  

You donâ€™t have to write all your Sass in a single  
file. You can split it up however you want with  
the @use rule. This rule loads another Sass file  
as a module, which means you can refer to its  
variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file  
with a namespace based on the filename. Using a  
file will also include the CSS it generates in  
your compiled output!  

```scss
// _base.scss
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}

// styles.scss
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
}
```

```css
body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

.inverse {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}
```
