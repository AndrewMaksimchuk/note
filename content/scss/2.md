# Partials  

You can create partial Sass files that contain  
little snippets of CSS that you can include in  
other Sass files.  

You might name it something like `_partial.scss`  

The underscore lets Sass know that the file is  
only a partial file and that it should not be  
generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used  
with the `@use` rule.
