# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax  

```
sparse index
```

The search results would include all documents  
containing both the terms sparse and index, in  
any order.  

To search for an exact string, including  
whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes.  

```
"sparse index"
```

You can use the operators AND, OR, and NOT to  
combine search terms.  
You can use parentheses to express more  
complicated boolean expressions.  

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"
```

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the  
language: qualifier.  

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp
```
