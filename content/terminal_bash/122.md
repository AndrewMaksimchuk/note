# alacritty - terminal emulator

## vi mode

The vi mode allows moving around Alacritty's viewport and scrollback using the keyboard. It also serves as a jump-off point for other features like search and opening URLs with the keyboard. By default you can launch it using `Ctrl` `Shift` `Space`.

## Selection

One useful feature of vi mode is the ability to make selections and copy text to the clipboard. By default you can start a selection using v and copy it using y. All selection modes that are available with the mouse can be accessed from vi mode, including the semantic (Alt v), line (Shift v) and block selection (Ctrl v). You can also toggle between them while the selection is still active.

## Vi Search

In vi mode the search is bound to / for forward and ? for backward search. This allows you to move around quickly and help with selecting content. The SearchStart and SearchEnd keybinding actions can be bound if you're looking for a way to jump to the start or the end of a match.
