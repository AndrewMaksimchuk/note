  There is no standard for knowing what the default terminal emulators is across distros.  
  You would only be able to guess it by looking into different system variables and config files.  
  ```
  terms=(emulator1 emulator2 emulator3)
    for t in ${terms[*]}
    do
        if [ $(command -v $t) ]
        then
            detected_term=$t
            break
        fi
    done
    echo $detected_term
  ```
