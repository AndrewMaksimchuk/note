# expect - programmed dialogue with interactive  
# programs  

Expect is a program that "talks" to other interactive programs  
according to a script.  Following the script, Expect knows what  
can be expected from a program and what the correct response  
should be.  An interpreted language provides branching and high-  
level control structures to direct the dialogue.
