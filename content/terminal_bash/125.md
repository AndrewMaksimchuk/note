# How can I redirect the output of multiple commands at once?

## To redirect stdout and stderr

```sh
date > file 2>&1
```

## Redirecting an entire loop

```sh
for i in "${list[@]}"; do
    echo "Now processing $i"
    # more stuff here...
done > file 2>&1
```

## Command grouping helps

```sh
{
    date
    # some other commands
    echo done
} > messages.log 2>&1
```
