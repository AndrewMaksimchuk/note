# grep show lines before and after match

For BSD or GNU grep you can 
use -B num to set how many 
lines before the match and 
-A num for the number of 
lines after the match.

```sh
grep -B 3 -A 2 foo README.txt
```

If you want the same number 
of lines before and after 
you can use -C num.

```sh
grep -C 3 foo README.txt
```

This will show 3 lines 
before and 3 lines after.
