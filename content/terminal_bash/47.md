# Join 2 files with some ids

Select lines from text file which have ids listed  
in another file  
The join utility is what you want. It does  
require the input files to be lexically sorted.  

```sh
join -t $'\t' <(sort ids.csv) <(sort table.csv)
```

Without needing to sort, the usual awk solution is  
```sh
awk -F '\t' 'NR==FNR {id[$1]; next} $1 in id' ids.csv table.csv
```
