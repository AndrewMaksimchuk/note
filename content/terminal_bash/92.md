# set - command syntax

```sh
set [options] [arguments]
```

In the context of the set command, [options] are  
settings or flags that are set or unset in the  
Bash shell environment. Use it to influence the  
behavior of defined shell scripts and help execute  
the desired tasks.  

- Set an option by using a minus sign (-) followed by the appropriate option.
- Unset an option by using a plus sign (+) followed by the appropriate option.

## Options
- `-m` Displays a message when a task completes.
- `-x` Prints out command arguments during execution.
- `-a` Marks all created or modified variables or functions for export.
- `-e` Instructs a shell to exit if a command fails, i.e., if it outputs a non-zero exit status.
- `-u` Treats unset or undefined variables as an error when substituting.
- `-b` Alerts the user upon background job termination.
