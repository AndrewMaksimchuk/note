# The double-parentheses construct (( ... ))

The (( ... )) construct permits arithmetic  
expansion and evaluation. In its simplest form,  
`a=$(( 5 + 3 ))` would set `a` to `5 + 3`, or `8`.  
However, this double-parentheses construct is also  
a mechanism for allowing C-style manipulation of  
variables in Bash, for example, `(( var++ ))`.  

```sh
(( a = 23 ))
(( a++ ))
(( --a ))
(( t = a<45?7:11 ))   # C-style trinary operator
echo $((0x9abc)) # double-parentheses arithmetic expansion/evaluation
```
