# Dictionaries

## Defining

```bash
declare -A sounds

sounds[dog]="bark"
sounds[cow]="moo"
sounds[bird]="tweet"
sounds[wolf]="howl"
``` 

## Working with dictionaries

```bash
echo "${sounds[dog]}" # Dog's sound
echo "${sounds[@]}"   # All values
echo "${!sounds[@]}"  # All keys
echo "${#sounds[@]}"  # Number of elements
unset sounds[dog]     # Delete dog
```

## Iteration

```bash
for val in "${sounds[@]}"; do
  echo "$val"
done

for key in "${!sounds[@]}"; do
  echo "$key"
done
```
