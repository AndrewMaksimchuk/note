The variable `$0` stores the name of the script or  
the command itself.  

The special character `$#` stores the total number  
of arguments.  

We also have `$@` and `$*` as wildcard characters  
which are used to denote all the arguments.  

We use `$$` to find the process ID of the current  
shell script, while `$?` can be used to print the  
exit code for our script.
