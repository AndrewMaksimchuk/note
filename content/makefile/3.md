# MAKEFLAGS

The `MAKEFLAGS` variable is automatically set up  
by `make`, and it contains all the flags and  
command line variables that you passed to the  
top-level `make`.  

The `MAKEFLAGS` variables will pass these options  
and variables down to each sub-make.  

```Makefile
MAKEFLAGS += --no-print-directory
```
