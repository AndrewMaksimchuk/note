# Special Built-in Target Names

## .PHONY  

The prerequisites of the special target .PHONY are  
considered to be phony targets. When it is time to  
consider such a target, make will run its recipe  
unconditionally, regardless of whether a file with  
that name exists or what its last-modification  
time is.
