# COUNT

The COUNT function returns the number of rows in a table, or the number of rows
that meet a specified condition. In the simplest case, you have

```sql
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM PAPERS ;
```

This returns a value of 10 because there are ten rows in the PAPERS table. You can
add a condition to see how many types of paper are available in Size 8:

```sql
SELECT COUNT (Size8)
FROM PAPERS ;
```
