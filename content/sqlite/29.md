# Concatenation operator

Besides the concat() function, SQLite provides the concatenation operator (||)
to join two strings into one string.

## Syntax

```sql
s1 || s2
s1 || s2 || s3
```

## Example

```sql
SELECT
    FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName
FROM
    Employees
ORDER BY
    FullName;
```

### Output of sql example
