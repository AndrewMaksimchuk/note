# Transaction

A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that is atomic with respect to recov-
ery. This means that if a failure occurs while a transaction is in progress, the
effects of the transaction are erased so that the database is left in the state it was
in before the transaction started. Atomic in this context means indivisible. Either
the transaction runs to completion, or it aborts in such a way that any changes it
made before the abort are undone.
