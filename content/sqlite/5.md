# Transaction

A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that 
is atomic with respect to recovery. This means 
that if a failure occurs while a transaction is 
in progress, the effects of the transaction are 
erased so that the database is left in the state 
it was in before the transaction started. Atomic 
in this context means indivisible. Either the 
transaction runs to completion, or it aborts in 
such a way that any changes it made before the 
abort are undone.

All changes and queries are __atomic__, 
__consistent__, __isolated__ and __durable__
(ACID).

## Transaction statements

First, open a transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

The transaction is open until it is explicitly 
committed or rolled back.
Second, select or update data in database.
Third, commit the changes:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

If not want to save the changes, you can roll 
back:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

## Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 1000
WHERE account_no = 100;

INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no, flag, amount, changet_at)
VALUES(100, '-', 1000, datetime('now'));

COMMIT;
```
