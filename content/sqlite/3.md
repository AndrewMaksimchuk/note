# Show Tables 

list all tables from the database:

```sqlite cli command
.tables
```

## Showing tables using SQL statement

You can use an SQL statement to retrieve all
tables in a database from the sqlite_schema table.

```sql
SELECT 
    name
FROM 
    sqlite_schema
WHERE 
    type ='table' AND 
    name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%';
```

In this query, we filtered out all tables whose
names start with `sqlite_` such as `sqlite_stat1` and
`sqlite_sequence` tables. These tables are the
system tables managed internally by SQLite.
