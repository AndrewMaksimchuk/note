# Foreign key constraints

To check whether your current version of SQLite 
supports foreign key constraints or not, you use 
the following command.

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys;
```

The command returns an integer value: 1: enable, 
0: disabled. If the command returns nothing, it 
means that your SQLite version doesnâ€™t support 
foreign key constraints.

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    supplier_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    supplier_name TEXT    NOT NULL,
    group_id      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id)
       REFERENCES supplier_groups (group_id) 
);
```

The supplier_groups table is called a parent 
table, which is the table that a foreign key 
references. The suppliers table is known as a 
child table, which is the table to which the 
foreign key constraint applies.

The group_id column in the supplier_groups table 
is called the parent key, which is a column or a 
set of columns in the parent table that the 
foreign key constraint references. Typically, 
the parent key is the primary key of the parent 
table.

The group_id column in the suppliers table is 
called the child key. Generally, the child key 
references to the primary key of the parent table.

```sql
INSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_name, group_id)
VALUES ('HP', 2);
```

## foreign key constraint actions

To specify how foreign key constraint behaves 
whenever the parent key is deleted or updated, 
you use the ON DELETE or ON UPDATE action as 
follows:

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_columns)
   REFERENCES parent_table(parent_key_columns)
      ON UPDATE action 
      ON DELETE action;
```

### SQLite supports the following actions:
- SET NULL
- SET DEFAULT
- RESTRICT
- NO ACTION
- CASCADE

```sql
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    supplier_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    supplier_name TEXT    NOT NULL,
    group_id      INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id)
    REFERENCES supplier_groups (group_id) 
       ON UPDATE CASCADE
       ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
